Where Henry Zhu found the time to create a podcast, I have no idea. This post details every procedural aspect of his experience creating a limited run podcast with [Nadia Eghbal](https://twitter.com/nayafia), from the format, to the name, cover art, recording and editing process, and more. The premise of the podcast itself, [Hope in Source](https://hopeinsource.com/), is really unique -- exploring the parallels between faith and open source software.
